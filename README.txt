************ Starting from Scratch **************
*************************************************

Starting from Scratch is a fluid-width, three
column theme for Moodle 2. It is a reasonably
clean Moodle theme that I use as a basis for
creating new client themes from scratch (hence
the name).

It has a basic settings page with the following
functions:
- Easy setting of theme colour from a list
- Changing the logo
- Changing the column width
- Adding a footnote
- Removing the link to moodlebites.com in footer
- Custom CSS box
